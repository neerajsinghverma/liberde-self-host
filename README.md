# Liberde

A self-hosted AI platform in the style of Claude.ai, with [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)
as the LLM engine — one API key gives every chat access to Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama,
and 400+ other models.

## The platform

| Piece | Where | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Web app** | `/` (this folder) | Next.js 15 app: chat, projects, artifacts, settings |
| **Platform API** | `/v1/*` routes | OpenAI-compatible REST API secured by Liberde API keys |
| **Desktop app** | `apps/desktop` | Electron shell that auto-starts and wraps the web app |
| **CLI** | `apps/cli` | Zero-dependency terminal chat client (`liberde`) |
| **Mobile** | PWA | Install from the browser ("Add to Home Screen") |

Everything is a client of the one Next.js server. Data lives in `data/liberde.db`
(SQLite, created on first run) — no external services required.

## Multi-user

Liberde is multi-user by design. Fresh installs run in **single-user mode** (no
login) until the first account is created at `/login` — that account becomes the
**admin and inherits everything** created before. After that, sign-in is
required, further signups are open (set the global `allow_signups` setting to
`0` to close them), and every user has their **own** OpenRouter key, settings,
chats, projects, memory, skills, connectors, scheduled tasks, and platform API
keys. Platform API keys resolve to their owner, and the task scheduler runs each
task as its owner. Shared artifact/chat links stay public by design.

**Team features**: project owners can share a project with other users by email
(Project page → 👥 Shared with). Members see the project in their sidebar, chat
with its instructions and knowledge files, but keep their own private chats;
only owners edit the project. Admins get a **Settings → Admin** tab: user list,
promote/demote admins, delete users (with all their data), and an
allow-signups toggle.

**Postgres/Vercel migration path** (deliberate design choices):
- All data access lives in `lib/db.ts` — port one file to swap SQLite for Neon
  (the SQL is portable except the PRAGMA and `ensureColumn` migrations)
- Sessions are DB-backed opaque tokens (no in-process state), auth in
  `lib/auth.ts`
- Every user-owned row carries `user_id`; the only SQLite-specific runtime
  dependency is `better-sqlite3` itself
- The in-process scheduler and MCP connection cache assume a long-lived Node
  process — on serverless, move the scheduler to Vercel Cron and expect MCP
  stdio connectors to become remote-HTTP-only

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start          # http://localhost:3000
```

On first launch the Settings dialog opens — paste an OpenRouter API key
(from https://openrouter.ai/keys). Alternatively put it in `.env.local`
as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=` (see `.env.local.example`).

For development: `npm run dev`.

## Features

- **Streaming chat** with stop, regenerate, and edit-and-resend
- **Any OpenRouter model**, searchable picker with pricing and context size;
  switch models mid-conversation
- **Bring your own clouds** (Settings → Providers) — add **Azure AI Foundry**
  deployments, **AWS Bedrock** models (via Bedrock API keys), **Google
  Gemini/Vertex**, or any **custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint** (Groq, Ollama,
  vLLM…). Their models appear in the picker as “Provider · model”, route
  directly to that cloud with your credentials, work with the tool loop, and
  are per-user — with **full feature parity**: the 🌐 Search toggle injects
  Liberde-run web results, PDFs are text-extracted server-side (pdf-parse),
  💭 Think maps to the standard `reasoning_effort` (with graceful retry), and
  cost chips work as **estimates** when you set the provider's $/1M token
  prices (external clouds report tokens, not dollars).
- **Models & pricing page** (`/models`, sidebar link) — the live OpenRouter
  catalog as browsable cards: per-1M-token prices, context size, capability
  filters (🖼 vision / 🔧 tools / 🎨 image gen / 🆓 free), sort by price,
  context, or newest (with NEW badges), your account's **live credit balance
  and usage**, and one-click "Chat →" or "Set default" per model
- **Web search, Claude-style** — every tool-capable model gets built-in
  `web_search` and `fetch_page` tools and decides on its own when to use them;
  the chat shows "🔍 Searching the web: …" activity, search cards with source
  chips, and citations under the answer. The 🌐 toggle remains as forced
  plugin-based grounding for models without tool support.
- **Deep Research** (🔬 toggle) — plans search queries, runs parallel web
  searches, and streams a synthesized, citation-numbered report with a live
  progress trail
- **Agent mode** (🤖 toggle) — plan-then-execute: breaks your goal into steps,
  executes each with the full tool belt (web search, page reading, MCP
  connectors, skills), shows the live plan checklist, then streams a final
  deliverable (often an artifact) with the executed plan recorded on it
- **Voice conversations** (🎧 in the header) — hands-free loop: speak, hear the
  reply read aloud, speak again (plus 🎤 dictation and 🔊 read-aloud per reply)
- **Editable artifacts** — ✏ edit any artifact yourself (saves as a new
  version), or select text and hit 💬 to ask for a targeted change
- **Office exports** — slides → **.pptx** (PowerPoint-editable, best-effort
  text extraction) and markdown docs → **.doc** (Word-openable), alongside
  HTML/PDF
- **Unified search** — the sidebar box searches chats, messages, projects,
  knowledge files, and artifact contents, grouped by kind
- **Preset directories** — one-click popular MCP servers and skill templates in
  Settings → Connectors / Skills
- **Analysis tool** — the model can run JavaScript in a browser sandbox
  (\`<liberdeRun>\` protocol); output feeds back automatically so it can compute,
  verify, and iterate (max 4 rounds per turn)
- **Scheduled tasks** (⏰ in sidebar) — daily or every-N-hours prompts run by an
  in-server scheduler, optionally with web search; each run lands in a new
  ⏰-prefixed conversation, with pause/resume/run-now controls
- **Connectors (MCP)** — add any MCP server (local stdio command or remote HTTP)
  in Settings → Connectors; its tools become callable by tool-capable models
  mid-conversation, with a live activity trail and expandable tool-result cards.
  Remote servers support bearer tokens **and the full MCP OAuth 2.1 flow**
  (discovery, dynamic client registration, PKCE): Test surfaces a 🔐 Authorize
  button, you sign in in the browser, and tokens persist per-connector.
- **Skills** — teach the model reusable procedures in Settings → Skills. It sees
  every skill's name + description and loads the full instructions only when the
  task matches (progressive disclosure); instructions can reference connector
  tools by name.
- **Branching** — editing or regenerating keeps the old tail as a variant;
  a ⑂ switcher appears at the fork so you can flip between versions
  (ChatGPT-style; branches never leak into each other's model context)
- **Organization** — star chats (pinned section), archive them (hidden but
  restorable), date-grouped history (Today / Yesterday / Previous 7 days…)
- **Starter prompts** on the welcome screen, **Ctrl+Shift+O** new chat,
  **Ctrl+K** search, per-chat **markdown export**
- **Extended thinking** (💭 toggle) — requests reasoning tokens and streams the
  model's thought process into a collapsible block, live while it thinks, with a
  "Thought for Ns" duration label on finished replies
- **Image generation** (🎨 toggle) — routes the prompt to an image model
  (default `google/gemini-3.1-flash-image`, configurable) and shows the result in-chat
- **Memory** — persistent AND model-editable: tool-capable models manage memory
  with `memory_save` / `memory_update` / `memory_forget` (each fact carries an
  id handle, so "actually I switched teams" updates the fact instead of
  duplicating it); non-tool models fall back to the `<liberdeMemory>` tag;
  view/delete everything in Settings → Personalization; never active in
  temporary chats. Agent-mode runs share the same memory tools.
- **Planner/executor model split** — optional Settings fields route agent &
  research *planning* and agent *step execution* to cheaper models while the
  final deliverable keeps your main model — big cost savings on long runs
- **Personalization** — "about you" and "response style" custom instructions
- **Voice** — 🎤 dictation (Web Speech API) and 🔊 read-aloud on any reply
- **Share chats** — publish an immutable public snapshot at `/share/<id>`
- **Temporary chats** — hidden from history, no memory, auto-purged after 24h
- **Full-text search** across chat titles *and* message content
- **Cost tracking** — every reply records its real OpenRouter cost and tokens
  (including tool rounds, web searches, research pipelines, and image gen);
  hover a reply for its cost, and the chat header shows the conversation total
- **Auto-titled conversations** (configurable cheap "title model")
- **Projects** — group chats under shared custom instructions + knowledge files
- **Artifacts** — first-class, versioned, publishable (see below)
- **Attachments** — paste images anywhere on the page (screenshots included),
  drag & drop files onto the window, or upload: images (auto-downscaled to
  ~1568px like Claude, thumbnail previews, vision-model warning), **PDFs**
  (parsed via OpenRouter's free file-parser engine), and text/code files
- **Markdown** rendering with GitHub-flavored tables and syntax highlighting
- **Dark/light** theme following the OS
- **PWA** — installable on phones; serves a manifest + service worker

## Artifacts

Liberde implements the same artifact architecture as Claude.ai:

- Every chat's system prompt teaches the model an inline tag protocol
  (`<liberdeArtifact identifier=... command=create|update|rewrite>`), so artifacts
  work with **any** OpenRouter model — no tool-calling required.
- `update` commands are exact str-replace patches (`<liberdeOld>`/`<liberdeNew>`),
  applied server-side to the previous version — small edits don't regenerate the
  whole artifact. `rewrite` replaces it. Every command creates a new **version**;
  step through them with the ‹ v2/3 › control in the panel.
- Types: `html`, `react`, `svg`, `mermaid`, `markdown`, `code`, and **`slides`** —
  full presentations: the model authors styled slide sections and Liberde wraps
  them in a deck shell with arrow-key/click navigation, a slide counter, ⛶
  full-screen **Present** mode, and print CSS that paginates one slide per page
  for PDF export; downloads are self-contained playable HTML decks.
  HTML/React/SVG/Mermaid render live in a sandboxed iframe (React is compiled
  in-browser with Babel and served deps from esm.sh: react 18, lucide-react,
  recharts, Tailwind CDN). While the model is still streaming an artifact, the
  panel mirrors it live. The system prompt maps deliverables to types
  (presentation → slides, website → html, app → react, report → markdown…).
- **Publish** any artifact from the panel: you get a stable public link at `/a/<id>`
  that either always shows the latest version (default, updates propagate on every
  edit) or pins a specific version. Unpublish kills the link. Viewers can **Remix**,
  which seeds a fresh conversation with the artifact so they can iterate independently.

Engine tests: `npx tsx scripts/test-artifacts.ts` (parser/versioning),
`node scripts/test-share-http.mjs <convId>` (publish/share/remix over HTTP),
`npx tsx scripts/test-features.ts` and `node scripts/test-features-http.mjs`
(memory, temp chats, search, chat sharing, image models),
`npx tsx scripts/test-tier3.ts` and `node scripts/test-tier3-http.mjs`
(analysis tool, scheduler, research).

## Platform API

Create a key in **Settings → Platform API keys**, then call the server like any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lbd-..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"stream":true}'
```

`GET /v1/models` lists models. Point any OpenAI SDK at `baseURL: "http://<server>/v1"`.

## CLI

```bash
cd apps/cli
npm link                      # installs the `liberde` command
liberde config --server http://localhost:3000 --key lbd-...
liberde                       # interactive chat
liberde -p "explain CORS"     # one-shot
liberde models claude         # filter model list
```

## Desktop app

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm install
npm start                     # launches the shell; starts the server if needed
npm run dist                  # build a Windows installer (electron-builder)
```

Set `LIBERDE_URL` to point the shell at a remote Liberde server.

## Architecture notes

- `lib/db.ts` — SQLite schema + data access (better-sqlite3, WAL mode)
- `lib/openrouter.ts` — upstream client, model cache, prompt assembly
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` — the streaming pipeline: persists the user turn,
  streams deltas as SSE, persists the assistant turn (also on client abort),
  then auto-titles new conversations
- `app/v1/*` — the public platform API; authenticates `lbd-` keys
  (SHA-256 hashes in the `api_keys` table) and proxies to OpenRouter using
  the server's own upstream key
- The web UI is a single client shell (`components/AppShell.tsx`) using
  `history.pushState` navigation so streams survive route changes

## Security

- The OpenRouter key is stored server-side (SQLite or env) and never sent to clients
- Platform keys are shown once at creation; only hashes are stored
- The web UI itself has no login — bind it to localhost or put it behind a
  reverse proxy with auth if you expose it beyond your machine
