 * Index every project's knowledge for semantic retrieval.

 * Uploading a file indexes it, which covers everything added after an

 * this, turning the feature on appears to do nothing: the setting saves, and
 * every existing project keeps quietly using the lexical scorer until each of
 * its files is re-uploaded. That gap is invisible from the interface, which is
 * the worst kind.
 *
 * Files that already have vectors for the current model are skipped, so running
